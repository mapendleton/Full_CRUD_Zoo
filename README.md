# Full_CRUD_Zoo

Homework Project for Sherek.

Not sure if the Swagger Doc is what you wanted for the front end, but you can test all the endpoints there so I thought it was sufficient.

I used a Postgres DB, very simple table :

Ex from the swagger doc :

If you want to pull and test it out, the connection string is in appsettings.json. 
You'll just need to create a Postgres DB and the animals table, update the connection string and you should be good to go.
